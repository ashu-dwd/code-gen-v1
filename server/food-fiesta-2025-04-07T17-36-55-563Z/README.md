# Food Fiesta - A Delicious Experience

## Project Overview

Food Fiesta is a single-page website designed to provide a seamless and visually appealing food ordering experience. Built with a focus on excellent UI/UX, the site features a vibrant yellow and blue color scheme and is fully responsive across all devices. We've utilized HTML, CSS (with custom animations), and minimal JavaScript, and leveraged Bootstrap for structure and styling to create a dynamic and engaging platform.

*   **Responsive Layout:** Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Engaging Animations:** CSS animations enhance user interaction and create a dynamic experience.
